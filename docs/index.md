# Welcome to our Bootcamp Hands On üë®‚Äçüíª

We prepared these couple guided laboratories as a complement to our Remote Bootcamp, to help you understand some of the services that GCP has to offer.

The laboratories are meant to adopt 5 services in order to deploy a simple "hello-world" web application

- GCS cloud storage buckets for storing files and to serve static content. (most easy)
- GCE VM install everything from scratch and deploy the webapp. (medium)
- GKE Kubernetes cluster for running the webapp. (hard)
- App Engine for running the webapp. (easy)
- Cloud Functions for running the webapp. (easy)



!!! note
    You will have the option to choose from a Python app or a NodeJS app, the services covered in the labo
