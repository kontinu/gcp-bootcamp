# Lab 1


In this tutorial you will:

- Point your domain to Cloud Storage by using a CNAME record.
- Create a bucket that is linked to your domain.
- Upload and share your site's files.
- Test the website.


### Before

1. In the Google Cloud Console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

> Note: If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.


2. Make sure that billing is enabled for your Cloud project. Learn how to confirm that billing is enabled for your project.

3. (Optional) Have a domain that you own or manage. If you don't have an existing domain, there are many services through which you can register a new domain, such as Google Domains.
> This tutorial uses the domain example.com.
