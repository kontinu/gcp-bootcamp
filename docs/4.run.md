# Cloud Run

!!! info
    Develop and deploy highly scalable containerized applications on a fully managed serverless platform.
    - Write code your way using your favorite languages (Go, Python, Java, Ruby, Node.js, and more)
    - Abstract away all infrastructure management for a simple developer experience
    - Built upon the container and Knative open standards, enabling  portability of your applications


## Benefits & Features

### Container to production in seconds
Write code your way by deploying any code or container that listens for requests or events. Build applications in your favorite language, with your favorite dependencies and tools, and deploy them in seconds.

### Fully managed
Cloud Run abstracts away all infrastructure management by automatically scaling up and down from zero almost instantaneously—depending on traffic. Cloud Run only charges you for the exact resources you use.

### Enhanced developer experience
Cloud Run makes app development and deployment simpler and faster. And it’s fully integrated with Cloud Code, Cloud Build, Cloud Monitoring, and Cloud Logging for an enhanced end-to-end developer experience.

### Any language, any library, any binary
Use the programming language of your choice, any language or operating system libraries, or even bring your own binaries.

### Leverage container workflows and standards
Containers have become a standard to package and deploy code and its dependencies. Cloud Run pairs great with the container ecosystem: Cloud Build, Cloud Code, Artifact Registry, and Docker.

### Pay‐per‐use
Only pay when your code is running, billed to the nearest 100 milliseconds.

### Fast autoscaling

Cloud Run automatically scales up or down from zero to N depending on traffic.

### Redundancy

Cloud Run services are regional, automatically replicated across multiple zones.

### Integrated logging and monitoring
Out-of-the-box integration with Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logging, Cloud Trace, and Error Reporting to ensure the health of an application.
