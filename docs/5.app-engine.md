# App Engine

App Engine is a framework and computing platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers. App Engine offers automatic scaling â€” as the number of requests increases, it automatically allocates more resources for the application to handle the additional demand.
A quick look at the docs indicates that App Engine provides standard and flexible environment

## [Overview](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/nodejs/an-overview-of-app-engine?utm_source=medium_tthw)


Your App Engine app is created under your Google Cloud project when you create an application resource. The App Engine application is a top-level container that includes the service, version, and instance resources that make up your app. When you create your App Engine app, all your resources are created in the region that you choose, including your app code along with a collection of settings, credentials, and your app's metadata.

Each App Engine application includes at least one service, the default service, which can hold many versions, depending on your app's billing status. For more information, see Limits below.

  # This configures Google App Engine to serve the files in the app's static
  # directory.
- url: /static

  # This handler routes all requests not caught above to your main app. It is
  # required when static routes are defined, but can be omitted (along with
  # the entire handlers section) when there are no static files defined.
