Under Construction 🚧

# 2. GCE

### Pre requisites

- have a basic understanding of linux OS.
- have a basic understanding of bash scripting.
- use package managers or have a basic understanding of how to install packages.

### Hello World on Compute Engine.


Compute Engine lets you create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure. Compute Engine provides control of every component but also assumes it’s your responsibility to keep things running. With VMs, you obviously need to go ahead and install/configure your own web hosting stack from scratch (and also decide how to provide for load balancing and scalability, from a variety of options.)

The GCP documentation looks extremely useful, but who starts by reading the manual? Google Search to the rescue:

- “google compute engine create a vm”
- “google compute engine ssh into vm”
- “install python linux”
- “hello world python”
- “hello world python google compute engine”…

### Plan

- Create a VM on GCE (Linux obviously)
- Install python3 and/or node.js on the VM.
- Use hello-world app provided in the repo.
- Run the app and expose it on a public IP address.
- Can we scale?

## 1. Create a VM on GCE

Navigate to VM Instances page in Google Cloud Console and go through the setup process.

- Instance name: changed to helloworld-vm
- Machine type: changed to small (1 shared vCPU, 1.7 GB memory)
- Zone: changed to us-west-a (I am based in Seattle, so selected one of the ‘west’ options available)
- Boot disk: Google Debian GNU/Linux 9 (default)
- Firewall: checked to allow both HTTP and HTTPS traffic

!!! pricing
    $14.20 per month estimated.

Hit the Create button. The VM instance is up and running in literally a few seconds.

- Connect via SSH.

if you prefer to use gcloud, you can use:

- SSH 🔽: View gcloud command

```bash
gcloud compute --project "kontinu" ssh --zone "us-west1-a" "helloworld-vm"
```


## 2. Install python3 and/or node.js on the VM

### Python3

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3
```

### Node.js

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
